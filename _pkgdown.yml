  desc: >
    In cases where observations are randomly allocated into binary groups, any group effect estimand is
    most robustly estimated using plug-in estimation and estimating the variance using influence functions

  desc: >
    When historical data is available from one group, a (prognostic) model can be fit to the historical
    data, which is then used to predict outcomes for all observations and used as a covariate in the model
    to improve efficiency
