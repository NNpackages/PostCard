\arguments{
\item{ATE}{The average treatment effect \eqn{ATE = \mathbb{E}[Y(1)] - \mathbb{E}[Y(0)] } data is generated from}

\item{ATE.shift}{ATE shift in the historical data, when historical data contains treatment group patients}

\item{N.covs}{Number of covariates in the data generating process, indexed as x1,...,x_N.covs}

\item{N.overspec}{Number of overspecified covariates (generates covariates not used in the data generating process, but can be used in model specifications to simulate overspecification). They are indexed as x_{N.covs+1},..., x_{N.covs+N.overspec}.}

\item{coefs}{Coefficients for a, b and c in \eqn{Y(w) \sim N(aX^TX+bX+cXW+ATE\cdot W)}}

\item{mu.shift}{Mean shift in the historical data "away" from mean 0 in rct data (to simulate skewed historical distribution relative to RCT data).}

\item{cov}{Covariance structure of normally distributed covariates (simultaneous between "true" and overspecified covariates)}

\item{noise}{Std. err of error term in generated data}

\item{N.hist.control}{Number of patients in historical control groups}

\item{N.hist.treatment}{Number of patients in historical treatment groups}

\item{N.test.control}{Additional number of historical control group patients having same distribution as "hist" (if provided, these can be used for preliminary power estimation; see power.est argument for lm.hist)}

\item{N.test.treatment}{Additional number of historical treatment group patients having same distribution as "hist" (if provided, these can be used for preliminary power estimation; see power.est argument for lm.hist)}

\item{N.control}{Number of patients in current RCT control groups}

\item{N.treatment}{Number of patients in current RCT treatment groups}

\item{N.sim}{Number of generated historical and RCT datasets}

\item{parallel}{Logical value. If TRUE the simulations are done using parallelisation using future::plan(future::multicore), which resolves futures asynchronously (in parallel) in separate forked R processes running in the background on the same machine.This is NOT supported on Windows. Reason for not using future::multisession is that this creates and error, probably stemming from a bug in future::multisession.}

\item{workers}{Number of cores to use for parallelisation.}
}
\value{
Same as for \link{simulate_collection}.

\description{
Wrapper of \link{simulate_collection} where covariates and the outcome in both historical and current data is modelled using a normal linear distribution as \eqn{Y(w) \sim N(a^\top X\!\!\!:\!\! \!X + b^\top X + c^{\top} X W + \text{ATE}\cdot W,  \sigma^2)}
}
